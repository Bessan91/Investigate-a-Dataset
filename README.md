<h1>Data Analysis Projects - Udacity</h1>
<p>During my Data Analysis course at Udacity, I developed several projects. One of them is Investigate a Database, which explores various aspects of a movie database, including cast and crew information and movie metadata.

<h3>It was an incredible learning experience diving deep into data exploration, visualization, and storytelling. Some key takeaways from the project:</h3>
 <p>
✔️ Addressing complex analytical questions <br>
✔️Exploring datasets effectively (1D & 2D) <br>
✔️Creating multiple insightful visualizations<br>
✔️Ensuring clarity in communication and report structuring
